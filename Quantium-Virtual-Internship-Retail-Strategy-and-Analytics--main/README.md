# Quantium Virtual Internship - Retail Strategy and Analytics  (Ongoing)

### Performance Evaluation and Analysis of Supermarket Changes using Transactional and Customer Data.

This project aims to evaluate the performance of various changes made by a large supermarket brand using transactional and customer data provided by Quantium. As an analyst within the Quantium analytics team, my task is to deliver highly valued data analytics and insights to help the business make strategic decisions.

The supermarket regularly changes its store layouts, product selections, prices, and promotions to satisfy customer needs, keep up with market competition, and capitalize on new opportunities. The Quantium analytics team is engaged in these processes to evaluate and analyze the performance of these changes and recommend whether they have been successful.

To achieve this goal, I will be working with large datasets, cleaning and transforming the data, performing statistical analysis, and visualizing the results to provide meaningful insights to the business stakeholders. The project will involve the use of tools and technologies such as Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Jupyter Notebook.

The project deliverables include a comprehensive report on the performance of the changes made by the supermarket, including recommendations on areas of improvement and future opportunities. The report will be presented to the business stakeholders for strategic decision-making.
