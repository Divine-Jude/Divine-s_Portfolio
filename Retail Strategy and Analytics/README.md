# Retail Strategy & Analytics

## Case Study: Performance Evaluation and Analysis of Supermarket Changes using Transactional and Customer Data.

### Project Overview
The Quantium Retail and Analytics Project aims to leverage transactional and customer data from a data partnership with a large chips supermarket brand to deliver valuable data analytics and insights. As an analyst within the Quantium analytics team, the goal is to provide strategic recommendations and support decision-making processes within the supermarket business. This project focuses on evaluating and analyzing the performance of changes made in store layouts implemented by the supermarket brand, its Impact on Customer Behaviours and provide insights to optimize store layouts for better results.

### Problem
The supermarket regularly makes changes to their store layouts to improve customer experience, optimize product placement, and increase sales. However, it is important to evaluate the impact of these changes to determine their effectiveness and make informed decisions.

### Data
- The project utilizes transactional and customer data provided by the supermarket brand through the Quantium data partnership. The data includes:
Transactional data: Purchase information, including date, store number, loyalty card number, transaction id, product number, product name, product quantity, total sales.
- Customer data: loyalty card number, lifestage, premium customer.

### Methods
The project involves several key analytics skills and techniques, including:

- Data wrangling: Cleaning, transforming, and integrating the transactional and customer data to prepare it for analysis.
- Programming skills: Utilizing programming language like Python to conduct data analysis and implement statistical models.
- Statistical analysis: Applying statistical techniques to uncover patterns, correlations, and trends in the data.
- Data visualization: Creating visualizations, such as bar charts, column charts, and line charts, to explore and present the data effectively.
- Critical thinking: Formulating hypotheses, testing them, and drawing meaningful conclusions from the analysis.
- Commercial thinking: Considering business implications and providing actionable insights to guide strategic decision-making.

- Sales are coming mainly from Budget — older families, Mainstream — young singles/couples, and Mainstream — retirees.

- There are more Mainstream — young singles/couples and Mainstream — retirees who buy chips. This contributes to there being more sales to these customer segments, but this is not a major driver for the Budget — Older families' segment.

- Older families and young families in general buy more chips per transaction.

- The Mainstream — midage single/couples and young singles/couples are more willing to pay more per packet of chips compared to their budget and Premium counterparts. This may be due to Premium shoppers being more likely to buy healthy snacks, and when they buy chips, this is mainly for entertainment purposes rather than their own consumption. This is also supported by there being fewer Premium — midage single/couples and young singles/couples buying chips compared to their Mainstream counterparts.

- Mainstream — young singles/couples are 23% more likely to purchase Tyrrells chips compared to the rest of the population.

- Mainstream — young singles/couples are 56% less likely to purchase Burger Rings compared to the rest of the population.

- Mainstream — young singles/couples are 27% more likely to purchase a 270g pack of chips compared to the rest of the population, but let’s dive into what brands sell this pack size.

- A Larger pack size of 270g is only offered by Twisties, which may explain why the target segment has a higher affinity towards this pack size. This could indicate a higher likelihood of the target segment purchasing Twisties over other brands.

### Results
From the Assessments,

1. The results show that the trial in store 77 is significantly different to its control store 233 in the trial period as the trial store performance lies outside the 5% to 95% confidence interval of the control store in two of the three trial months.

2. The results show that the trial in store 86 is not significantly different to its control store in the trial period as the trial store performance lies inside the 5% to 95% confidence interval of the control store in two of the three trial months.

For Number of Customers,

Number of customers is significantly higher in all of the three months. This seems to suggest that the trial had a significant impact on increasing the number of customers in trial store 86 but as we saw, sales were not significantly higher.

Assessing Number of Customer, 

Total number of customers in the trial period for the trial store is significantly higher than the control store for two out of three months, which indicates a positive trial effect.

### Conclusion
Sales have mainly been due to Budget — older families, Mainstream — young singles/couples, and Mainstream — retirees' shoppers. We found that the high spend in chips for Mainstream — young singles/couples and retirees is due to there being more of them than other buyers. Mainstream — midage and young singles/couples are also more likely to pay more per packet of chips. This is indicative of impulse buying behaviour.

We’ve also found that Mainstream — young singles/couples are 23% more likely to purchase Tyrrells chips compared to the rest of the population. The Category Manager may want to increase the category’s performance by off locating some Tyrrells and smaller packs of chips in discretionary space near segments where young singles/couples are frequent more often to increase visibility and impulse behaviour.

I found control stores 233, 155, 237 for trial stores 77, 86 and 88 respectively.

The results for trial stores 77 and 88 during the trial period show a significant difference in at least two of the three trial months but this is not the case for trial store 86. We can check with the client if the implementation of the trial was different in trial store 86 but overall, the trial shows a significant increase in sales.
