# ACCENTURE NORTH AMERICA DATA ANALYTICS AND VISUALIZATION
Virtual Experience Program

# Case study
Social Buzz was founded by two former engineers from a large social media conglomerate, one
from London and the other from San Francisco.

Due to their rapid growth and digital nature of their core product, the amount of data that they
create, collect and must analyze is huge. Every day over 100,000 pieces of content, ranging
from text, images, videos and GIFs are posted.

One of Accenture’s Managing Directors, Mae Mulligan, is the client lead for Social Buzz.
She has reviewed the brief provided by Social Buzz and has assembled a diverse team of Accenture experts to deliver the project.
Mae has scheduled a project kick off call with the internal Accenture project team for tomorrow morning.
Ahead of the call, Mae has shared the project brief so you can get up to speed on what Social Buzz need help with.

# Project Understanding:
- The client, Social Buzz, is a rapidly growing company that generates and collects a large amount of data from their core product, which is a social media platform.
- They require help from Accenture to analyze their data and provide recommendations for a successful IPO.
- As a Data Analyst, the task is to analyze their content categories and identify the top 5 categories with the largest aggregate popularity.

# Requirements for the Project:
- Conduct an audit of Social Buzz's big data practices to identify areas for improvement and optimization.
- Provide recommendations for a successful IPO that are supported by data analysis.
- Analyze their content categories and identify the top 5 categories with the largest aggregate popularity.

# Tasks for Data Analyst:
- Conduct data cleaning and modeling to ensure that the data is accurate and appropriate for analysis.
- Analyze the content categories and calculate their aggregate popularity, which can be done by analyzing the number of posts, likes, comments, shares, and other relevant metrics.
- Visualize the results using appropriate data visualization techniques and tools.
- Tell a compelling story that highlights the key insights and recommendations based on the analysis.
- Present the results and recommendations to the client in a clear and concise manner.


# Data analysis process
There is a lot of information here and it’s easy to get lost in the data. So, 
to make sure you are using the right data to answer the business questions, how did I tackle this problem?
Well I approached it in 5 steps:

- Data understanding - the key to success on any data project is to understand
the data in detail. So we took the time to understand the data model and
domain of your business.

- Data cleaning - after understanding your business, we then cleaned the
available datasets and thought about what an ideal dataset should look like for
this problem.

- Data modelling - after ensuring the data was clean for analysis, we needed
to process and model this data into a dataset that can precisely answer the
business questions and produce the results needed.

- Data analysis - with our new dataset, we used our analytical expertise to
uncover insights from this dataset and to produce visualizations to describe the
insights.

And finally we used these insights to unlock business decisions and to make
recommendations on next steps.

# Data Model
A data model - this shows the relationships between all of the data sets, as well as any links that you can use to merge tables.

From your data we found that you had a total of 16 unique categories of posts
across your sample dataset. This includes things such as Food, Science and
Animals.

As well as this, there were 1897 reactions from just the animal category alone!
People obviously really like animals!

And also the most common content type for users to post within was Photos. This
could be due to the visual nature of photos which can be more attention grabbing
and easier to understand compared to Gif, video and audio.

But now, onto the main question... which is... what were the top 5 most popular
categories of posts?

![Annotation most popular contents](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95667763/219061475-e571c09a-bffc-4c64-9191-4bf7d707fb26.png)

From our analysis you can see the top 5 most popular contents were Animals, Science, Healthy Eating, Technology, Food in descending order.  Animals had an aggregate popularity score of around 74965. This data suggests that users are particularly interested in content related to animals, science, and healthy eating, with technology and food also being popular topics.

Animals and science are broad categories that can encompass a wide range of subtopics, from cute animal videos and photos to scientific research and discoveries. Healthy Eating is another broad category that may include information about nutrition, diet, and wellness. 

Technology is a broad and dynamic category that can include a wide range of topics, from the latest smartphones and laptops to cutting-edge research in fields like artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Food is another broad category that can encompass everything from recipes and cooking tips to restaurant reviews and food-related news.

It's worth noting that these are just general trends, and it's important to consider the specific interests of your target audience ensuring that this content are opposed to individual users at the forefront of user feeds.

![Annotation % split of popularity between the top 5 categories](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95667763/219062924-2c71e6c9-652c-47ed-8e2e-689ebacdfe41.png)

Additionally, you can see from this chart the % split of popularity between the top 5 categories. There is not much difference between the share of each category, however, the difference between the 1st most popular, animals and the 2nd most popular, science, is the largest gap equal to 1.1%. 

In business terms, this could suggest that the most popular category, animals, is tailing away from the rest of the categories and may continue to get more and more popular. To avoid an issue where 1 content category consumes the entire platform, it will be important for you to ensure that any algorithms used to govern the content on the platform gives a fair balance to the content categories.


# Summary & Recommendations
So to summarize:
We tackled this task and found the top 5 most popular categories as asked, but we also went one step further.

- We found that animals and science are the two most popular categories,
suggesting that users like "real-life" and "factual" content.

- We also found that food was a common theme amongst popular content and
the most popular food category was healthy eating. This could be a signal to
show the types of people that are using your platform, and you could use this
insight to boost engagement even further. For example, you could run a
campaign with content focused on this category or work with healthy eating
brands to promote content.

It's worth noting that these are just general trends, and it's important to consider the specific interests of your target audience ensuring that content are opposed to individual users at the forefront of user feeds.

Social Buzz can leverage this information to 
better understand their audience optimize their content strategy  and to drive growth on their platform.
Based on the valuable insights obtained from this ad-hoc analysis, Social Buzz should consider partnering with Accenture to expand this analysis on a larger scale for real-time understanding of the business and to deliver even more value.
